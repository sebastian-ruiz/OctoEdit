## OctoEdit
Do you ever find yourself in the situation where you'd really like to be able to access your code only to be away from your work computer? This is where OctoEdit fills the gap, it's fast and lightweight allowing one to edit their site wherever there is an Internet connection.
How does it beat other services such as cloud 9? It's completely open source and it can run from any Apache server (so any shared hosting)

## Where can I get it?
Iâ€™m hosting the project on GitHub so feel free to download the repository or fork and contribute! OctoEdit is still under development so please note that I cannot be held responsible for any problems that may occur through the usage of the code. If you do however find a bug, send me an email or file an issue.
